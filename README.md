# 8-MCP23017-Small-Chip-PCB

Thank you JLCPCB for sponsoring this project.

We are using the smaller size MCP23017 version for this project.

The MCP23017 uses the SDA and SCL for the I2C communication between it and a microcontroller such as an Arduino.

The MCP23017 PCB can provide up to 128 inputs or outputs.

The A0, A1, A2 of the MCP are binary selectors where A2 is the most significant bit (MSB). They are used to configure the MCP selection on the Arduino.

The PCB also comes with the CS and SO lines which are not applicable for this project currently as there is no smaller version of the MCP23S17 which operates on the SPI protocol.

The MCPs are powered by 5V.
